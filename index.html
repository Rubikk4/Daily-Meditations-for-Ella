		<h3>The gospel is the only essential message ever to exist.</h3>

	    <p>
So many people go through life without deeply understanding the gospel or basing their life strength on it. We were all taught the gospel at some point, but then moved on to other things. But how can this be something that we move on from? The gospel is an elementary idea that we should spend all the days of our lives pondering on.
<br><br>
"The gospel is not only the most important message in all of history; it is the only essential message in all of history" (Jerry Bridges). Think about it: If a person could know one thing before they die - if a person is in a severely disabled state so they can only know and believe one fact, let it be the free offer of the gospel in Jesus Christ! 
  <p>
<h3>Two courts - in heaven and in our hearts.</h3>
	    <p>
"There are two “courts” we must deal with: the court of God in heaven and the court of conscience in our souls. When we trust in Christ for salvation, God’s court is forever satisfied. Never again will a charge of guilt be brought against us in heaven. Our consciences, however, are continually pronouncing us guilty. That is the function of conscience. Therefore, we must by faith bring the verdict of conscience into line with the verdict of heaven. We do this by agreeing with our conscience about our guilt, but then reminding it that our guilt has already been borne by Christ." (Jerry Bridges. The Discipline of Grace - Jerry Bridges (Kindle Locations 694-698). Kindle Edition.)
<br><br>
In the court of heaven we are eternally right with God. However, the court of our consciences need to be reminded of heavens verdict. Therefore, we need to preach to ourselves the gospel of salvation on a daily basis. Remind yourself that you are right with God every day.
  <p>
<h3>How do you preach the gospel to yourself every day?</h3>
	    <p>
We are "simul justus et peccator" ("at the same time righteous and a sinner"), and we need to remind ourselves of that. 
<br><br>
Start with the fact that on the one hand, while I am a saint I am also a sinner - I sin every day in thought, word, and deed. Acknowledge specific sins if you can. Try to be honest with yourself and root out where you have gone wrong. Apart from acknowledging specific sins, think on the fact that you are by your own behaviour and actions deserving of God's just punishment. "I fall short in my love for You and for my neighbour!" 
<br><br>
Now comes the moment to affirm your own sin and misery apart from Christ, but to acknowledge what God has accomplished and applied for you in Christ. Read a Scripture passage daily to affirm this to your hungry soul. "There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ!" (Rom 8:1). "Although my conscience accuses me that I have grievously sinned against all God’s commandments, have never kept any of them, and am still inclined to all evil, YET GOD, without any merit of my own, out of mere grace, imputes to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ" (HC, LD 23). 
<br><br>
Let this truth of the gospel be a balm to your soul. Beyond it affirm to yourself all the riches of the gospel: You are not only forgiven, but given a new identity of adopted child, of one united to Christ, He indwells you with his Holy Spirit, renews your behaviour, and promises an eternity in where you will dwell in God's glowing presence! 
<br><br>
This is the foundation of the Christian life is it not? What is more glorious than this? Dwelling in the glorious truth of the gospel? What higher joy is there for us, what greater motivator for the Christian life than the gospel of salvation in Jesus Christ. Preach it to yourself every day.

      <h2>Day 4: Rom 8:31-37</h2>
	<p class="scripture">"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."</p>
